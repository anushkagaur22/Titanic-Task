# Titanic-Task
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival.  
EDA techniques were applied using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

##  Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

##  Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset (`train.csv` from Kaggle).  
2. Cleaned missing values (filled Age, Embarked; dropped Cabin).  
3. Conducted **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate** analysis.  
4. Visualized relationships using:
   - Histograms
   - Boxplots
   - Bar plots
   - Heatmaps
   - Pair plots  
5. Summarized key findings.

##  Key Insights
- **1st Class passengers** had higher survival rates.  
- **Females and younger passengers** survived more often.  
- **Higher fares** linked to increased survival probability.  
- **Cabin** column removed due to high missing data.
